## Description
Created as part of my first year university coursework, named oddly to prevent any plagarists from scouring github for code to copy paste. 

The task was to create a program that would run on a raspberry pi robot, and allow the robot to successfuly navigate towards brighter areas around it. 
This was one of the toughest tasks that we were allowed to choose from but I knew it would be fun learning a bit of image processing so I chose it. I had plenty of spare time so I implemented some bonus features like having it move towards darker areas of the room, more indepth tracking, and other misc things.

Here are the design flowcharts, if anyone is curious: <br/>
